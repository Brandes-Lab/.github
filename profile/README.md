# Brandes Lab at NYU

## Welcome to the [Brandes Lab](https://brandeslab.org) Github Repository!

We develop AI models for genomic analysis, leveraging **protein language models (pLMs)** to predict protein function, variant effects, and disease associations. Our work bridges AI and statistical genetics to identify causal variants, optimize genetic sequences, and extend AI applications to the non-coding genome.
